Gravatar Tools for CakePHP 2.0


This project separates the url generation from the CakePHP image tag
generation in the helper.  It provides the same url generation capability
as a component if you need to build avatar urls outside of the view context.

The upstream CakePHP 1.X helper can be found here (packaged as a plugin):
https://github.com/hharnett/cakephp-gravatar-helper


Installation

copy GravatarHelper.php to app/View/Helper/
copy GravatarComponent.php to app/Controller/Component/


Helper Usage

In your controller:
class MyController extends AppController {
  public $helpers = array('Gravatar');
...
}

In your view:
<?php echo $this->Gravatar->image('guest@example.com', array('size' => 98), array('alt' => 'Gravatar')); ?>
